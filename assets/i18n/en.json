    "description": "<p class=\"text-justify\">I found in programming the perfect hobby and job for this curiosity. Not only because of that, but also because, although I like talking to people and socializing, I consider myself an introvert and love the feeling of being in front of the code with my music.</p><p class=\"text-justify\">  Among some of my personal achievements is having worked as a freelance developer creating apps for various startups, as I always wanted to know what it was like to work on my own, although I left it after a year because I spent a lot of energy looking for clients and handling bureaucracy. I have also managed to have two apps with thousands of downloads on the Play Store (Stormii and Consumii). Lastly, I achieved one of my dreams: traveling solo through Asia without dying in the attempt (so far). Although this may seem quite irrelevant to programming, I feel that it has greatly improved my problem-solving skills.</p>"
